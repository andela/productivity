# Slack
Please read [this blog post](https://www.fastcompany.com/40402380/i-work-at-slack-heres-how-i-use-it-to-manage-my-workday) for inspiration! 


Let's quickly clarify the differences between `@here` and `@channel`.
`@here` notifys EVERYONE in a channel that is in that channel and currently active (aka green dot)
`@channel` notifies EVERYONE in a channel, whether or not they are online. (AKA every.single.person)
`@everyone` same as `@channel`

## Helpful Slack Commands
### [Reminders!!!](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/208423427-Set-a-reminder) (Slack's best kept secret)
#### Set a reminder

In the message box, type `/remind` and include the following: 
`/remind` `[@someone or #channel] [what] [when].` 

Here are some examples:
`/remind` me every weekday at 2pm to drink more cold brew
`/remind` @katie You‚Äôre amazing! in 45 minutes
`/remind` #culturechats on July 31st at 10:55am PST to join the biweekly meeting

_Type me to remind yourself, the @[display name] of another member to send the reminder to them, or the #channel-name of a channel to send an open reminder there._

*_Note: Guests can't set reminders for other members, and reminders can't be set for User Groups._
*_Note: You can‚Äôt set recurring reminders for other members._

#### Message Reminders
When you want to follow up on a conversation or remind yourself of a task, you set a reminder for any message in Slack. Just hover over the message and click the `Show message` actions icon, select `Remind me about this`, and choose a timeframe from the list.

#### Manage Reminders
Use the `/remind list` command in any channel or direct message to view upcoming, past, or incomplete reminders ‚Äî Slackbot will return a list that only you can see.

Here, you have the option to Delete any of your reminders or mark them as Complete. Click `View completed reminders` to see all reminders you‚Äôve marked complete.

_**Snooze Reminders**_
If you're not ready to act on your reminder, just click one of the options to reschedule the reminder: in 15 minutes, 1 hour, or tomorrow.

### [To-Do List](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/224766507-To-do-lists-in-Slack-)
#### Star messages to create to-do items
Use stars to create a to-do list by starring messages and files that need your attention. Just click the star icon at top right to open the Starred Items pane ‚Äî and there‚Äôs your to-do list! Just remove a star when the item‚Äôs done. üî®

#### Create a post with a checklist (I'll admit, I don't use this but will start checking it out)
If you need a more traditional to-do list with items you can check off, you can do this in a [post](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/209774578) using checklist formatting. Just share the post in a relevant channel so others can edit the list or see the progress made.

### [Other Slash Commands](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201259356-Slash-commands)
There are a lot of slash commands, that you can view in the üîó ‚òùÔ∏è . I'm not going to go through them all but I'll list my favorites

| Action | Keyboard Shortcut | 
|---|---|
| Toggle Active Status | `/` active |
| Toggle Away Status | `/` away |
| Invite someone to a channel | `/` invite `@user`|
| Join a channel| `/` join |
| Leave a channel | `/` leave|
| Mute a channel, or unmute a channel that is muted | `/` mute |
| Start a Bluejeans | `/ zoom` |

*[You can also create a custom emoji!!!](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206870177-Create-custom-emoji)

## Slack Bots!

You can find a list of [already Andela Approved Slack bots](https://andela.slack.com/apps/category/approved). If you find one you want to use, that is not on that list, you can put in a request from that page. 

Some basic ones: 

- Todo Bot: create a todo list and reminders with that list
- Polly: create a poll... (can be recurring)
- Standuply: automate standups
- Uber: call an uber from slack (I have not personally used this one)
- Troops: Search/edit salesforce
- Google Calendar: Get a morning agenda or alerts before meetings, changes, etc

# [Alfred App](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

Alfred is the best thing that ever happened to me. I describe it as Mac Spotlight on steroids. 
**To set it up, follow these steps:**
1. Download the [app](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
2. `System Preferences` `Spotlight` `Keyboard Shortcuts...` and UNCHECK `Show Spotlight Search`
3. Open Alfred App 
4. Go to `General` tab
5. Highlight `Alfred Hotkey`
6. Type `cmd` `space`

## Set up a Web Search

e.g. Salesforce search
1. Open salesforce
2. In search bar type `test`
3. Copy URL
4. Open Alfred (`cmd` `space` `alfred`)
5. Go into Features -> Web Search
6. Click `Add Custom Search`
7. Paste URL, Title: Salesforce, Keyword: sf
8. Save

**_To run this, `cmd` `space` `sf company name`, `enter`.
